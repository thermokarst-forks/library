  <h2>About the QIIME 2 Library</h2>
  <p>
    This site is currently an early (but still useful) example of our plans for
    supporting the continued decentralized development of QIIME 2. Our goal is
    that this site becomes a one-stop-shop for finding resources and software
    related to the QIIME 2 ecosystem. The central goal is that this site will
    be <em>community driven</em>, where developers and authors can share
    information with their users, and where users can discover tools and
    resources.
  </p>

  <h4>Phase 1 (We are here!)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Provide a central collection of available QIIME 2 plugins that can be
      installed. Plugins can be added by any forum member with a trust level of
      1 or more.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Phase 1.1</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Add interfaces to the site, allowing developers to add their own, and
      allowing users to discover new ones.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the "official" QIIME 2 plugins to the Library. These are the plugins
      that are built and maintained by the
      <a href="https://forum.qiime2.org/u/q2d2">@q2d2</a> /
      <a href="https://github.com/orgs/qiime2/people">@qiime2 team</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Phase 2</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Support a <em>revision controlled</em> and automated ingest of plugin and
      interface information. This will reduce the burden on developers to
      specifically manage the content on this site and allow further automated
      tooling to exist. One option for this is for a developer to tell Library
      where to find it's source, and Library automatically interrogates the
      project to learn more.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide a new section of the site for creating <em>automatically</em>
      tested tutorials. This will require a way to upload (or share)
      testing/tutorial datasets. Additionally the site will need a task-queue
      to execute the tutorials.
    </li>
    <li>
      Plugins and interfaces should have well defined installation scripts by
      this point to support automated tutorial testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Support search and categorization of content available on the site. Maybe
      this could be accomplished with tags and customized search panels.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Phase 2.1</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Improve the various index pages to provide better overviews of available
      content. Perhaps we could set up something like an "App Store," with
      "Featured Plugin" or "Featured Tutorial."
    </li>
    <li>
      Migrate existing tutorials from
      <a href="https://docs.qiime2.org">docs.qiime2.org</a> to
      <a href="https://library.qiime2.org">library.qiime2.org</a>.
      Ideally users will visit the Library to learn about the latest and
      greatest techniques and tools available in QIIME 2.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Phase 3</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Provide more advanced descriptions of plugin information such as
      automatically documenting actions, types, and formats (effectively
      replacing the
      <a href="https://docs.qiime2.org/2018.8/plugins/available/">
        "Available Plugins" section of the User Docs
      </a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      By this point, the docs.qiime2.org should have become a relatively brief
      description of QIIME 2 and how to use it, while all domain specific
      documentation has been migrated to this site.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Phase "the more distant future"</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create customizable automated installers, which install only plugins and
      interfaces requested. Think of this like a "shopping cart" - you pick and
      choose the plugins and interfaces you want, the Library makes an
      installer for you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide a mechanism for user to review plugins and provide ratings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create an automated checklist of "best practices" to additionally rank
      plugins by, such as "install-ability", test coverage, the presence of
      documentation, etc.
    </li>
  </ul>
